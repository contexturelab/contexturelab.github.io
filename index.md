## About the Lab

The Contexture Lab focuses on developing methods of network science, representation learning, and geometry to understand social phenomena as continuous, dynamic processes rather than discrete categories. We study how individual interactions weave together to create complex social structures, treating categories like "success," "innovation," or "community" not as fixed labels but as emergent patterns in a continuous social fabric.

**The Geometry of Knowledge.** The lab analyzes and models the structure of knowledge and innovation using representation learning, with a focus on revealing the "lost reality" obscured by categorizations. We search for universal structures that cut across not just science, but also technology, law, and other intellectual domains. Our goal is to understand how knowledge hierarchies and temporal dynamics shape these ecosystems, uncovering the fundamental structure of human intellectual systems. 

**Computational Constructionism.** The lab develops representation learning methods that operationalize social constructionist theory, treating social categories as constructed rather than natural. We use representation learning to reverse-engineer how societies construct categories, revealing the continuous spectra that exist before labels are applied. Our goal is to create computational systems that preserve nuance and resist binary classification, respecting the contextual nature of human experience.

**Agentic Structures.** The lab builds computational agents that can navigate complex social contexts as participants rather than external observers. These agents understand meaning relationally, through the web of connections rather than through isolated features. Our work aims to develop computational tools that respect the fabric of social reality and can reason about context, emergence, and the spaces between categories.
