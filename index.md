## About the Lab

The Contexture Lab studies how humans are embedded in and directed by the structures around us—how these structures influence how individuals live, form groups, and advance as collectives. Drawing on structuralist traditions, we search for ubiquitous patterns that appear across different systems and domains as manifestations of fundamental structures that underpin our society. Our core analytical approach is representation learning, which allows us to recover the continuity that exists in nature before we impose discrete categories upon it.

**Representation Learning as Structural Analysis.** We impose categories and boundaries on continuous phenomena to aid understanding, but this introduces biases and misunderstandings. The lab develops representation learning methods to bring continuity back into our analysis of social systems, capturing the subtle yet critical nuances lost in categorization. Following structuralist principles, we identify binary oppositions and test whether they serve as invariants, while recognizing that phenomena are better characterized by continuous spectra than by discrete partitions.

**Universal Patterns Across Domains.** The lab searches for patterns that cut across science, technology, law, and other intellectual domains. By analyzing knowledge networks, innovation structures, and social constructions, we reveal the geometric and temporal properties that shape these systems. Our goal is to uncover the fundamental structures that manifest repeatedly across different contexts, showing how categories like "success," "genius," or "community" emerge from continuous processes rather than existing as natural kinds.

**Context and the Embedded Individual.** The lab emphasizes that we are all embedded in contexts—where we live, what we do, what we have, who we interact with—and that these contexts fundamentally shape our experience. We develop methods and tools that respect this embeddedness, preserving nuance and resisting reduction to simple categories. Understanding how individuals and collectives are situated within larger structures is central to everything we do.
