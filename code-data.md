## Data Sharing Policy

We are committed to:
- **Open Source**: All research code is released under permissive licenses (MIT/Apache 2.0)
- **Reproducibility**: We provide code to reproduce all figures and results in our papers
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation and examples for all tools
- **Data Access**: Public datasets are shared through established repositories (Zenodo, OSF, etc.)

For datasets that cannot be publicly shared due to privacy concerns, we provide:
- Synthetic datasets with similar properties
- Data access protocols for qualified researchers
- Aggregate statistics and anonymized summaries

## Computational Resources

Our research is supported by:
- Binghamton University High-Performance Computing cluster
- NSF XSEDE allocations (pending)
